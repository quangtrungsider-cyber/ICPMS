# Authorization — IAM & Policy

Policy-based authorization in `pkg/iam/` using an evaluation model similar to AWS IAM. Explicit deny > explicit allow > implicit deny.

**Policies are Go code, not database rows.** All policy logic is assembled from Go structs at startup (`pkg/probo/policies.go`, `pkg/iam/iam_policies.go`). The database only stores the `authz_role` enum and membership rows — there is no `policies` or `permissions` table. Never create migrations for policy storage.

## Core concepts

**Policy** — a named collection of statements:
```go
policy.NewPolicy("thirdParty-crud", "ThirdParty CRUD",
	policy.Allow(ActionThirdPartyGet, ActionThirdPartyList).WithSID("read-thirdParties"),
	policy.Deny(ActionThirdPartyDelete).WithSID("deny-thirdParty-delete"),
).WithDescription("Standard third party access")
```

**Statement** — a single permission rule with effect (allow/deny), actions, optional resources, and optional conditions.

**Action format** — `SERVICE:RESOURCE:OPERATION` with wildcard support:
```
core:thirdParty:create      # specific action
core:thirdParty:*           # all third party actions
core:*                  # all core actions
*                       # everything
```

## Policy evaluation

The evaluator processes all statements against a request:

1. If any statement explicitly denies → `DecisionDeny`
2. If any statement explicitly allows → `DecisionAllow`
3. No match → `DecisionNoMatch` (implicit deny)

## Authorizer flow

`Authorizer` is the main orchestrator in `pkg/iam/authorizer.go`:

```go
scope, err := iamService.Authorizer.Authorize(ctx, iam.AuthorizeParams{
	Principal:          identityID,    // who
	Resource:           thirdPartyID,      // what
	Action:             probo.ActionThirdPartyGet,  // which action
	ResourceAttributes: map[string]string{},    // optional extra attributes
})
```

The flow:
1. Load organization membership for the resource's organization
2. Load principal attributes (identity + membership role)
3. Load resource attributes via `AuthorizationAttributes()` on the entity
4. Build policies: identity-scoped + role-specific
5. Evaluate all policies
6. Return an authorization scope (`*coredata.Scope`) for downstream data access
7. Return `ErrInsufficientPermissions` if no allow match

## Batch authorization

Use batch authorization when a caller needs all-or-nothing authorization across
multiple resources for the same action:

```go
scope, err := iamService.Authorizer.AuthorizeBatch(ctx, iam.AuthorizeBatchParams{
	Principal: identityID,
	Action:    probo.ActionTaskDelete,
	Resources: taskIDs, // all resources must have same entity type + organization
})
```

Batch semantics:
- **All-or-nothing** — the first denied resource returns `ErrInsufficientPermissions`
- **Single-entity-type batch** — mixed entity types return `ErrMixedEntityTypeBatch`
- **Single-organization batch** — mixed or missing `organization_id` attributes return `ErrMixedOrganizationBatch`
- **Empty resource list** returns `ErrEmptyResourceBatch`
- **Batch attributes are required** — each resource type in `AuthorizeBatch` must implement batch attributes loading or it returns `ErrBatchAuthorizationUnsupportedResourceType`
- **Shared `ResourceAttributes` map** is applied to every resource in the batch
- **Audit logs** are written per resource only when all resources are authorized (`DryRun` skips logs)

GraphQL wrappers can use `authz.NewBatchAuthorizeFunc(...)` with
`authz.WithBatchAttr`, `authz.WithBatchDryRun`, and
`authz.WithBatchSkipAssumptionCheck`.

MCP resolvers can use `Resolver.AuthorizeBatch(ctx, resourceIDs, action)` for
the same behavior and error mapping as single-resource authorization.

## PolicySet

Policies are organized into identity-scoped (applied to all authenticated users) and role-based:

```go
ps := iam.NewPolicySet().
	AddRolePolicy("OWNER", OwnerPolicy).
	AddRolePolicy("ADMIN", AdminPolicy).
	AddRolePolicy("VIEWER", ViewerPolicy).
	AddIdentityScopedPolicy(SelfManagePolicy)
```

Register during service initialization:
```go
iamService.Authorizer.RegisterPolicySet(ProboPolicySet())
```

## Conditions (attribute-based access control)

Conditions constrain when a statement applies. All conditions must be satisfied.

```go
// Users can only access resources in their organization
organizationCondition := policy.Equals("principal.organization_id", "resource.organization_id")

policy.Allow(ActionThirdPartyGet).
	WithSID("view-thirdParty").
	When(organizationCondition)
```

| Operator | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `policy.Equals(key, value)` | Key equals value |
| `policy.NotEquals(key, value)` | Key does not equal value |
| `policy.In(key, value)` | Key in list (supports comma-separated DB fields) |
| `policy.NotIn(key, value)` | Key not in list |

Key paths use `principal.ATTR` or `resource.ATTR` (e.g., `principal.organization_id`, `resource.source`).

## AuthorizationAttributer interface

Resources that support authorization must implement this interface in `pkg/coredata/`:

```go
func (v *ThirdParty) AuthorizationAttributes(
	ctx context.Context,
	conn pg.Querier,
	resourceIDs []gid.GID,
) (map[gid.GID]map[string]string, error) {
	q := `SELECT id, organization_id FROM third_parties WHERE id = ANY(@resource_ids::text[])`

	rows, err := conn.Query(ctx, q, pgx.StrictNamedArgs{"resource_ids": resourceIDs})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot query third party authorization attributes: %w", err)
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	attrsByID := make(map[gid.GID]map[string]string)
	for rows.Next() {
		var id, organizationID gid.GID
		if err := rows.Scan(&id, &organizationID); err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot scan third party authorization attributes: %w", err)
		}
		attrsByID[id] = map[string]string{"organization_id": organizationID.String()}
	}
	if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot iterate third party authorization attributes: %w", err)
	}

	return attrsByID, nil
}
```

The returned map provides attributes for condition evaluation (e.g., `resource.organization_id`).
`AuthorizationAttributes` implementers should assume caller-side preconditions:
- `resourceIDs` is non-empty
- `resourceIDs` is deduplicated
- in `AuthorizeBatch`, all resources are the same entity type

Implementers should return only found rows keyed by id. Missing resources are handled by caller-side per-resource existence checks.

## Error types

```go
var (
	ErrInsufficientPermissions // access denied
	ErrAssumptionRequired      // session assumption needed
	ErrUnsupportedPrincipalType // principal is not an Identity
)
```

## Integration in resolvers

**GraphQL resolvers** use `AuthorizeFunc` from `pkg/server/api/authz/`:
```go
scope, err := r.authorize(ctx, thirdPartyID, probo.ActionThirdPartyGet)
if err != nil {
	return nil, err
}
```

**MCP resolvers** use `Authorize` and return early on error:
```go
scope, err := r.Authorize(ctx, input.ID, probo.ActionThirdPartyGet)
if err != nil {
	return nil, types.GetThirdPartyOutput{}, err
}
```

### Always take `scope` from `authorize` — never reconstruct it

`authorize` (and `Authorize` in MCP) returns a `*coredata.Scope` that has been
resolved from the resource's `organization_id` attribute. Pass that scope
straight to the service/coredata layer instead of building a new one with
`coredata.NewScopeFromObjectID(...)` after the authorize call.

The two are not strictly identical: `NewScopeFromObjectID(id)` only reads the
tenant component of the GID, while the authorizer derives the scope from the
loaded resource attributes (and may be extended to compute it differently in
the future). Reconstructing the scope from the GID bypasses that and silently
drifts when the resource lookup changes.

```go
// GOOD — scope comes from authorize, fed straight to the service
scope, err := r.authorize(ctx, obj.ID, probo.ActionThirdPartyList)
if err != nil {
	return nil, err
}

thirdPartyIDs, err := r.cookieBanner.LoadDistinctThirdPartyIDsByCookieBannerID(ctx, scope, obj.ID)

// BAD — authorize discards scope, then we rebuild it from the same GID
if _, err := r.authorize(ctx, obj.ID, probo.ActionThirdPartyList); err != nil {
	return nil, err
}

scope := coredata.NewScopeFromObjectID(obj.ID)
thirdPartyIDs, err := r.cookieBanner.LoadDistinctThirdPartyIDsByCookieBannerID(ctx, scope, obj.ID)
```

The only time it is acceptable to write `if _, err := r.authorize(...)` is when
**no downstream call needs a scope** — typically authorize calls against the
caller's `identity.ID` for global / cross-tenant catalogs (e.g.
`ActionCommonThirdPartyList`, `ActionCommonThirdPartyGet`) whose service
methods are unscoped. In that case the returned scope would be derived from
the identity (a nil-tenant principal) and is useless to the caller, so
discarding it with `_` is correct:

```go
// GOOD — global catalog, downstream is unscoped
identity := authn.IdentityFromContext(ctx)
if _, err := r.authorize(ctx, identity.ID, probo.ActionCommonThirdPartyList); err != nil {
	return nil, err
}

parties, err := r.thirdParty.Search(ctx, name) // no scope argument
```

For batch authorization, the same rule applies to `r.batchAuthorize` (GraphQL)
and `r.AuthorizeBatch` (MCP) — keep the returned scope and pass it down.

## Action constants

IAM actions live in `pkg/iam/iam_actions.go`, probo actions in `pkg/probo/actions.go`. Follow the naming pattern:

```go
const (
	ActionThirdPartyGet    = "core:thirdParty:get"
	ActionThirdPartyList   = "core:thirdParty:list"
	ActionThirdPartyCreate = "core:thirdParty:create"
	ActionThirdPartyUpdate = "core:thirdParty:update"
	ActionThirdPartyDelete = "core:thirdParty:delete"
)
```

## Built-in role policies

| Role | Access level |
|------|-------------|
| `OWNER` | Full access to all features including org management |
| `ADMIN` | Full access to core features, restricted org management |
| `VIEWER` | Read-only access to most entities |
| `AUDITOR` | Read-only, excludes internal/employee content |
| `EMPLOYEE` | Can sign documents and view internal content |

## New entity IAM wiring

When adding a new entity that needs authorization:

1. **Action constants** — add `core:<entity>:<verb>` constants in `pkg/probo/actions.go` (get, list, create, update, delete)
2. **Role policies** — wire actions into the appropriate role policies in `pkg/probo/policies.go` (`OwnerPolicy`, `AdminPolicy`, `ViewerPolicy`, etc.) with `organization_id` condition
3. **`AuthorizationAttributes`** — implement on the `coredata` entity struct, returning at minimum `{"organization_id": ...}` (use the denormalized `OrganizationID` field — see coredata doc)
4. **Entity type registry** — register in `pkg/coredata/entity_type_reg.go` and `NewEntityFromID` so the authorizer can construct the entity from its GID
5. **Resolver calls** — add `scope, err := r.authorize(ctx, id, probo.ActionEntityGet)` in GraphQL resolvers and `scope, err := r.Authorize(ctx, id, probo.ActionEntityGet)` in MCP resolvers, then pass `scope` to services

## Key patterns

- **Always use `organization_id` condition** — most policies scope access to the principal's organization
- **SID every statement** — `.WithSID("description")` for debugging
- **Explicit denies for restrictions** — even if allow would match, deny takes precedence
- **Identity-scoped for self-management** — cross-org permissions like managing own profile
- **Role-based for org features** — CRUD operations on domain entities
