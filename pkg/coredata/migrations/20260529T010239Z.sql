-- A signature applies to a whole major version: minor publishes keep it and the
-- export unions signatures across every minor of the major. A signatory must
-- therefore have at most one signature per (document, major). Historically the
-- request guard was scoped to a single minor version, so re-requesting on a
-- newer minor (or twice on the same version) inserted duplicate rows, making a
-- person appear several times on the exported signature page.
--
-- Collapse each (document, major, signatory) group to a single signature,
-- keeping the same row the application now prefers: a SIGNED signature over a
-- pending one, then the most recently created.
