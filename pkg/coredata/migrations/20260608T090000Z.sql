-- Drop the agent-run worker lease. Recovery from a crashed worker is now
-- manual (inspect logs, move the row out of RUNNING by hand). Known stops
-- transition explicitly: graceful shutdown returns the row to PENDING and
-- approval pauses park it in AWAITING_APPROVAL, so nothing relies on a
-- timeout to requeue. Re-introduce leasing here when the system matures.
