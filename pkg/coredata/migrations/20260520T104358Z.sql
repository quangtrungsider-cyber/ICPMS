-- The register/document model has fully replaced the snapshot system. Delete the
-- snapshot-scoped data; the schema (snapshot_id / source_id columns, snapshots
-- table, controls_snapshots, snapshots_type enum, snapshot-scoped indexes) is
-- dropped in a follow-up migration.

-- processing_activity_third_parties stores snapshot_id without an FK to snapshots,
-- so the cascade delete below would not reach it. Clean it up explicitly first.
DELETE FROM processing_activity_third_parties WHERE snapshot_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Every other table with a snapshot_id has a FOREIGN KEY (snapshot_id) REFERENCES
-- snapshots(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, so deleting all snapshots removes every
-- snapshot-scoped row across data, third_parties, assets, risks, findings,
-- obligations, processing_activities, statements_of_applicability,
-- applicability_statements, the third_party_* sub-tables, the processing_activity
-- DPIA/TIA tables, and the controls_snapshots junction.
DELETE FROM snapshots;
