-- Fix tracker_patterns rows created with entity type 88 (removed
-- CookiePatternEntityType) instead of 89 (TrackerPatternEntityType),
-- and detected_trackers rows migrated from the cookies table with entity
-- type 85 (removed CookieEntityType) instead of 90 (DetectedTrackerEntityType).
-- Rebuild each GID by replacing the entity type bytes and re-encoding.
